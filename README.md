# Bad-Apple-NDS

## Building
To build, you must have devkitPro with libnds installed. Then just go into the project directory and run `make`

## Running
If you are running the homebrew through Unlaunch or no$gba, put `BadApple.kpv` onto the root directory of your SD card. Otherwise put it into the same directory as the `.nds` file. Now just run the `.nds` file in DSi mode with SD card access.

## Credits
I didn't do all of this myself. I got a lot of help from **Gericom**, who also made [the original version](https://gbatemp.net/threads/bad-apple-for-the-nintendo-ds.466504/) 4 years ago, which this version is heavily inspired by.

## Encoding your own video
The source code for the encoder will be uploaded soon&trade;. I still need to comment and clean the code though.
